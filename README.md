# Object of Game: 
Collect Points by getting Landscapes (Cards) & Flowers

# Game Ends: 
After the last person in the round plays and at least one person has 15 points. 
The person with the most points wins. Ties are broken by who has the least amount of cards. 

# Play Options: 
(see demonstration below)
1. Take 3 tokens of different colors (or 2 of the same color if you can leave 2 or more in the community pile)
2. Pay for a card with your current tokens/cards
3. Take 1 gold token and reserve a card

# Taking tokens
Taking tokens from the community pile adds them to your stash where you can use them to buy cards (landscapes)
You may never have more than 10 tokens in your stash at one time. *Gold tokens are wild and can be used as any color

# Paying for a card
If you have enough cards/tokens to pay for a card (cost show on the bottom left) it will have a gold glow around it. Paying
for the card will cost you the amount of tokens on the bottom left less the amount of cards you have. (e.g. a card cost 3 diamonds
and you have 2 diamond cards. You would only have to put one diamond token back)


# Reserving a Card
Reserving a Card removes that card from the community play area and puts it into your reserved deck. Only you can see this deck
and only you can buy this card on a later turn. You'll see the black square by your character have a gold glow if any of your reserved 
cards can be boughten. 

# Taking a Flower
If at the end of your turn you have enough cards to take a flower. The available flowers will pop-up and allow you to pick one. Flowers cost
can be found on the left side of the card. Flowers cost are cards but you do not have to give up your cards for a flower. *Once take a card, there is 
no scenario in which you'd have to give it up.*
